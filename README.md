Vash syntax for Sublime Text
============================

Tired of having to look at boring old HTML while using the [Vash](http://github.com/kirbysayshi/vash) templating engine?

```html
<title>@model.reallyBoringTitle(Boo)</title>
```

# ME TOO

Wish there was some sort of *package* or *syntax highlighting* that gave you interesting colors for keywords, the transition character, and other Vash related syntax?

# ME TOO

what can we do?

# GET THE VASH PACKAGE

Introducing the package for [Sublime Text]() that does just that. It's just a plain old file but it does **so much**. Like highlight your Vash!
