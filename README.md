Vash syntax for Sublime Text
============================

Tired of having to look at boring old HTML while using the [Vash](http://github.com/kirbysayshi/vash) templating engine?

### ME TOO

Wish there was some sort of *package* or *syntax highlighting* that gave you interesting colors for keywords, the transition character, and other Vash related syntax?

### ME TOO

What can we do?

# GET THE VASH PACKAGE

Introducing the package for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) that does just that. It's just a plain old file but it does **so much**. Like highlight your Vash!

## Installation

Turns out it's easy. Like really easy.

#### Via [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/)

1. `cmd(ctrl) + shift + p` -- for Command palette
2. type `install` -- for installing new packages
3. type `vash` -- to search for Vash
4. Hit `return` -- to download and install
5. Celebrate that your Vash files are now EXCITING

#### That Manual Way

##### OSX

```bash
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/
$ git clone https://github.com/theoperatore/VashSyntaxDefinition.git
```
Celebrate that your Vash files are now EXCITING
##### Linux
```bash
$ cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/
$ git clone https://github.com/theoperatore/VashSyntaxDefinition.git
```
Celebrate that your Vash files are now EXCITING

##### Windows

I believe the correct path for windows is:

```command
> cd %AppData%\Sublime Text 3
> git clone https://github.com/theoperatore/VashSyntaxDefinition.git
```
Celebrate that your Vash files are now EXCITING

## Using IT

Once installed, Sublime Text will read any `*.vash` file and automatically change your syntax to Vash.

Otherwise `cmd(ctrl) + shift + p` it up and search for `vash`

Then of course:

#### Celebrate that your Vash files are now EXCITING
